# Producer-Consumer
This code gives you the knowledge about creating a new error, concurrency. There is a shared resource called sharedQueue, and there are 5 computers and 3 printers what we do is, the computers send data to the queue and the three printers' print them without misleading the document, this is an example code to demonstrate idea. 

in this example i have created the printers not to take the .exe type files, so that i have created a error to handle it otherwise it will cause and issue according to the problem statement
